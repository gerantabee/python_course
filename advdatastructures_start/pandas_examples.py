import pandas as pd

# file path = "../data/sat_scores.csv"
# Let's load data from this file into a new Pandas DataFrame, and get its profile


#Note that in Python shell you need to force a print of the head (vs. Colab)
# Use head(), describe(), shape and info() to explore your data

#use sort_values to sort on one or more columns
#Add inplace=True after showing the sort the first time
# Use debug and DataFrame view to see the data in real-time



# Let's add more data from another file and join them
# Use shape to find out the shape of your data


# Use eval() to calculate and add columns (feature engineering)



# Finally we can write our DataFrame to a CSV

# Query a subset of the data to make a new DataFrame of highest grades
