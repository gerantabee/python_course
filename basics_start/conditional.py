grades = [55, 65, 75, 80, 91, 62, 50, 70]

# Another example
state = "NY"
ordervalue = 25.00

# INDENTATION MATTERS!
# Let's calculate sales tax based on state and order value



# If the order value is below a certain amount we can skip sales tax


# Another syntax, using shorthand
print(55 in grades)

# Filtering using list comprehension

# Match / case
# "New York", "Los Angeles", "Dallas"


# Try and catch exceptions
# Defined tuple of days of week
# Tuple elements cannot be modified
days_of_week = ("Sunday","Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday","Friday","Saturday")

# Throws a TypeError
