# Variables are loosely typed in Python, and dtype is flexible with assignment


# variables can be defined several at a time using ,,, notation


# Strings added to int/floats will throw an error
# You can correct them or cast the string using int() or float()
# try adding a string version of a number to an int


# Lists are sorted, changeable colelctions that allow duplicates
# They are analogous to arrays in other languages
# Make a list from values or other  variables
# You an use list methods such as sum() to add values


# Make a list from raw ints
# 55, 65, 75, 80, 91, 62, 50, 70


# grades_average = sum(grades) / len(grades)
# Create a grades curve by adding a total value or individuals to raise
# grades_average = sum(grades) + 120 / len(grades) #wtf??
# Order of operators!




# Tuples are ordered, can be appended but items can't be modified, duplicates NOT allowed
# "Sunday","Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday","Friday","Saturday"
# Use sorted() to sort values
# or loop through values

# Debug this as we never actually update the main list
grades = [55, 65, 75, 80, 91, 62, 50, 70]
grades_updated = []

# for grade in grades add 15 points each


# OR enumerate



print(grades)

# Print the original grades list

# Use list comprehension
grades_updated_lc = []
